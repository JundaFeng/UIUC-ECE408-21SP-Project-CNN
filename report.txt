2. List Op Times (CPU convolution implemented) for batch size of 10k images
79464.3+230304 = 309768.3 ms
3. List whole program execution time (CPU convolution implemented) for batch size of 10k images
6m39.668s
4. Show percentage of total execution time of your program spent in your forward pass function with gprof.
83.83 percents

GProf output:
83.83    322.41   322.41        2   161.21   161.21  conv_forward_cpu(float*, float const*, float const*, int, int, int, int, int, int)
